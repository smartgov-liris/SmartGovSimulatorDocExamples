# SmartGovSimulatorDocExamples :rainbow: :sheep:


The [SmartGovSimulator](https://github.com/smartgov-liris/SmartGovSimulator) represents the generic part of SmartGov, that can be used to implement urban problems or any other graph based multi-agent problem.

This repository contains a [developer documentation](documentation/README.md), that will guide you through the simulator structure and explain how to implement nodes, arcs, agents and behaviors at different levels, in order to create a new instance of the simulator.

It also contains a complete implementation of the examples used in the documentation.
